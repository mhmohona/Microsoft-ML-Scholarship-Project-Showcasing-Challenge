# Azure ML Clustering - A Clustering Case Study on Automobile Data

### Implementation of KMeans clustering in Azure ML for clustering Automobiles and deploying the model as a web service.

Clustering is one of the important unsupervised learning techniques that can group the data points based upon their inherent properties. In unsupervised learning, there is no labelled data to train the machine learning model. That means there is no guidance or supervision to teach the model about the relationship between input features and output variable. The model itself tries to understand the relationships among the features and extracts the pattern hidden in it. In clustering, the learning algorithm understands this pattern and groups the data points into different segments based on the inherent properties. Segmentation is also crucial to solve several business problems. Segmentation allows us to understand the inherent properties of grouped data points. In this case study also, we will attempt to use clustering to segment data points related to automobiles.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/autompg-dataset

Each row of the dataset represents a car from the inventory, each column contains the car’s attributes. The attributes are given below:

- mpg: mileage per gallon
- cylinders: number of cylinders
- displacement: Engine displacement
- horsepower: Engine Horsepower
- weight: weight of the car
- acceleration: acceleration of cars - zero to sixty miles/hour time
- model year: year of model

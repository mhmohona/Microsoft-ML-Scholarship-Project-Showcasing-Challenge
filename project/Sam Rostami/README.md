Classification of water masses plays a fundamental role in understanding of relationship between ocean circulation and climate change.Also, it helps to understand the global ocean circulation, 
as well as influencing poleward heat transport, export of salt, and nutrient distributions. This study is foucusing on Cretaceous time about 66 milion years ago. 
There were different connections to other basins compared to today, with enhanced connections to east-west flow in the equatorial region.  In addition, PCO2 estimates of 530-620 ppm.
This study combines data for these chemical and biological proxies to reconstruct water mass sources, flow paths, and evolution of circulation patterns in the North Atlantic 
during the Campanian to Maastrichtian (80-60 milion years ago) to advance our understanding of the relationship between deep ocean circulation and climate at this time.
Therfore, I used Azure machine learning platform and compare four different algorithms to train my data and achive best model for prediction of different water masses in North Atlantic.
